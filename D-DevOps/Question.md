# Question 1 
What is the difference between a VM and a container? Give an example of each, perhaps from some work you have previously done?

A full virtualized system gets its own set of resources allocated to it, and does minimal sharing. You get more isolation, but it is much heavier (requires more resources).
With Docker you get less isolation, but the containers are lightweight (require fewer resources). So you could easily run thousands of containers on a host, 
# Question 2
You might have heard about gocd, cfengine, ansible and puppet? In a few sentences, describe a
situation when you have worked with each of those, or similar software? What problem were you
trying to solve, and how did the software help?
# Question 3
Give 3 examples of what you think could be easy wins for us to reduce AWS compute costs (or
another cloud technology you are familiar with)? Bonus: Have you ever had any experience of
monitoring and reducing cloud computing costs, briefly explain what you did?
